Description=You are playing a game of Checkers with another player. The goal is to eliminate all your opponent's pieces. But now you have an advantage of making a quantum move, due to which you can split your piece with equal probabilities on the board. You or your opponent can force a measurement on the piece during an attempted capture, revealing it's position. Each square is a qubit in the IBMQ Qiskit simulator.  Get ready to create Schrodinger's cat like pieces, both Alive and Dead.
